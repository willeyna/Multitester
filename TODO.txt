NEAR FUTURE TO-DO:

* Change where signal TS dist is being saved to/ called from [X]

* Add method arg dictionary for passing misc items in [ ]

* Add declination binning code with scrambling of background testing locations and injection locations within bands [ ]

* Change the calculation of sigma to be band dependent [ ]

* Change the way injection amounts are specified [ ]

* TC plots, contours, and sensitivity [ ]



LATER VERSIONS: 

* Multiple background distributions for one object [ ] 

* Outputs modes

* Add a path argument to run (for creation of sbatch) (right now you manually set up sbatch)
