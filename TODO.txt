NEAR FUTURE TO-DO:

* Fitting gamma in LLH -> dynamic p(tau) calculation

* Better minimization of LLH (multiple dimension minimization)

* N-dim pdfs (multidimensional interpolation)

* Flux + Sensitivity Calculation 

* SkyLLH integration 

LATER VERSIONS: 

* Multiple background distributions for one object 

* Add a path argument to run (for creation of sbatch) (right now you must manually set up sbatch)
